  <h1>🔓 OAuth Weaknesses – When Delegated Access Goes Wrong</h1>

  <h2>👶 For Beginners: What is OAuth?</h2>
  <p>
    OAuth is a secure authorization framework that allows users to grant limited access to their resources on one site (like Google) to another site (like a calendar app) without sharing their credentials.
  </p>
  <p>
    💡 For example: You use your Google account to log in to a third-party app. The app asks Google for permission to access your email or contacts on your behalf — that’s OAuth in action.
  </p>
  <p>
    But while OAuth is powerful, it’s not bulletproof. Poor implementations can lead to serious security issues.
  </p>

  <h2>🚨 Why are OAuth Weaknesses Dangerous?</h2>
  <p>OAuth weaknesses can result in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>🚪 Unauthorized access to user data</li>
    <li>👤 Account takeover</li>
    <li>🎭 Impersonation</li>
    <li>🔁 Token abuse and replay</li>
    <li>🕵️‍♂️ Bypassing authentication flows</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Many apps misconfigure or misuse OAuth, leaving the door open for attackers.</p>

  <h2>⚠️ Common OAuth Weaknesses</h2>

  <h3>1️⃣ Lack of State Parameter Validation (CSRF in OAuth)</h3>
  <p>OAuth flows often use a state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks. If not implemented properly, an attacker can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Trick users into authorizing the attacker’s app</li>
    <li>Hijack the OAuth authorization flow</li>
  </ul>
  <p>✅ Fix: Always use a cryptographically secure, unique state value and verify it on return.</p>

  <h3>2️⃣ Open Redirects in Redirect URIs</h3>
  <p>If an attacker can manipulate the redirect_uri to point to their domain:</p>
  <pre><code>redirect_uri=https://attacker.com/capture_token</code></pre>
  <p>They can intercept tokens or steal authorization codes.</p>
  <p>✅ Fix: Only allow pre-registered, exact match redirect URIs.</p>

  <h3>3️⃣ Leaking Tokens via Referrer or Logs</h3>
  <p>Access tokens or authorization codes included in URLs can be leaked:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Through browser history</li>
    <li>To third parties via Referer headers</li>
    <li>Through server logs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>✅ Fix: Use POST requests and authorization headers for token transmission.</p>

  <h3>4️⃣ Weak Client Secrets or Insecure Storage</h3>
  <p>Client secrets must be strong and securely stored. In mobile or frontend apps, they can be easily extracted and reused by attackers.</p>
  <p>✅ Fix: Use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) in public clients (mobile, SPA). Avoid using static client secrets.</p>

  <h3>5️⃣ Insecure Token Storage on Client</h3>
  <p>Tokens stored in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>localStorage (vulnerable to XSS)</li>
    <li>Insecure cookies (missing HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Can be stolen by attackers.</p>
  <p>✅ Fix: Store tokens in secure, HttpOnly cookies or use secure storage APIs.</p>

  <h3>6️⃣ ID Token Used Without Validation (OIDC Confusion)</h3>
  <p>Some apps accept ID tokens (from OpenID Connect) without verifying the issuer or audience. Attackers can use tokens from another provider (like a test environment) to gain access.</p>
  <p>✅ Fix: Validate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>iss (issuer)</li>
    <li>aud (audience)</li>
    <li>exp (expiry)</li>
    <li>Signature</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>7️⃣ Improper Scope Handling</h3>
  <p>OAuth allows fine-grained permission control using scopes. If an app doesn't enforce these properly:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Attackers may access more data than intended</li>
    <li>Tokens may provide broader access than expected</li>
  </ul>
  <p>✅ Fix: Use minimal scopes and validate scope permissions on each API request.</p>

  <h3>8️⃣ Access Tokens with No Expiry or Revocation</h3>
  <p>If tokens never expire, and there’s no way to revoke them:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Compromised tokens stay valid forever</li>
    <li>Logout doesn’t really "log out"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>✅ Fix: Set short expiry for access tokens and implement refresh tokens and revocation endpoints.</p>

  <h2>🔍 Example Attack: OAuth CSRF with Missing State Check</h2>
  <p>Attacker crafts a link to:</p>
  <pre><code>https://authserver.com/auth?client_id=evilapp&redirect_uri=https://attacker.com&response_type=code</code></pre>
  <p>Sends the link to the victim.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Victim clicks, logs in, and unknowingly authorizes the attacker's app.</li>
    <li>Attacker now uses the authorization code to get access to the victim's data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🛡️ Best Practices to Secure OAuth Implementations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🔐 Use PKCE for mobile and SPA apps</li>
    <li>🧾 Whitelist exact redirect URIs</li>
    <li>🛑 Validate state parameter</li>
    <li>🧪 Validate ID token claims</li>
    <li>⏳ Use short-lived access tokens</li>
    <li>🔁 Implement refresh tokens with proper revocation</li>
    <li>🔍 Log and monitor token usage</li>
    <li>📦 Store tokens securely</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🚀 Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>OAuth is not inherently insecure — but it’s only as strong as its implementation. Many developers treat it like a black box, overlooking critical security requirements.</p>
  <p>💡 Think of OAuth as giving someone a keycard to enter a building — but the card should only work for the right door, for a limited time, and it must be hard to duplicate.</p>
  <h3>✅ Secure your OAuth flows like you would protect your passwords — because in many cases, they are just as powerful.</h3>
